# First, in a POSIX-compliant terminal, change directory to the desired 
# repository holding path like so:
cd $HOME && mkdir .git
cd .git

# Initialize the local directory as a git resopsitory.
git init 

# Next, clone a git repsitory, using its url, like so:  
git clone https://github.com/TeamBlood/Path-Finding.git


# Change directory to the repository.
cd Path-Finding

# Synchronize local directory with your branch.
git remote show origin
git remote update
git fetch 
git checkout -t origin/Your-First-Name

# Make sure the directory is up-to-date.
git pull 

# You are now ready to add and edit files. 

# To append changes:
git add .

# To commit changes (only when satisfied with changes!):
git commit -m "description of change"

# To push changes, which should also prompt a github login:
git push origin HEAD:Your-First-Name

>>>>>>> master
